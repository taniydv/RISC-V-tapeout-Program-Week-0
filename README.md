# RISC-V-tapeout-Program-Week-0
Welcome to my journey of RISC-V tapeout program!!! 
In this program, we are designing the RISC-V core. Week 0 deals with the basic design flow of an SoC and its planning, which starts from the C-level program compiled using the GCC compiler and specs (C model). Then, this C-level program is converted to the RTL level, which is further divided into the processor and peripherals/IPs. This process is called the SoC design flow. After that, it is converted into SoC integration, and a GDSII file is obtained, which is then sent to the foundry for fabrication.
