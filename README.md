# RISC-V-tapeout-Program-Week-0
Welcome to my journey of RISC-V tapeout program!!! 
In this program, we learn to make the RISC-V and will be using open source tool. In week 0, there is general introduction from VLSI SoC design which starts from the C-program implementation and testing using GCC and specs(c model), which further moves to RTl, SoC design and GDSII file.
Task 1: Installation of open source tools
         i) iverilog
		 ii) GTKWAVE
		 iii) Yosys
